[![Rust Security Audit](https://github.com/Isbak/fatigue/actions/workflows/security_audit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Isbak/fatigue/actions/workflows/security_audit.yml) [![Deploy Edge Version](https://github.com/Isbak/fatigue/actions/workflows/webassembly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Isbak/fatigue/actions/workflows/webassembly.yml)

## Overview

This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for conducting structural fatigue assessments, leveraging the Rust programming language's safety and performance features. Designed with the engineering community in mind, it offers a code-based approach to evaluate structural integrity under cyclic loading conditions, crucial for various industries including aerospace, automotive, construction, and more.

The implementation focuses on modern fatigue analysis methods and algorithms, ensuring high accuracy and computational efficiency. By utilizing Rust, we emphasize safety (both in terms of software reliability and engineering outcomes) and speed, catering to large-scale simulations and data-intensive computations.

## Features

- **Safety and Reliability**: Our toolkit is constructed with Rust at its core, a language designed with safety in mind. Rust's strict compilation checks eliminate common programming errors such as null pointer dereferences and data races, ensuring that our toolkit operates with unmatched reliability. This foundational safety allows engineers to focus on innovation and design, confident in the robustness of the underlying computational engine.

- **High Performance**: Engineered for efficiency, our toolkit is optimized to deliver rapid assessments of even the most complex structural models. By leveraging Rustâ€™s performance characteristics, such as zero-cost abstractions and efficient concurrency management, it provides speed without sacrificing accuracy. This optimization ensures that our users can perform exhaustive analyses and simulations in reduced timeframes, accelerating the engineering process from concept to validation.

- **Modular Design**: The toolkit's architecture embodies flexibility, designed to fit seamlessly into a variety of engineering workflows. Whether it's a standalone tool for specific analyses or a component of a broader engineering software ecosystem, its modular design facilitates easy integration. This adaptability allows it to evolve alongside your projects, supporting a wide range of applications from preliminary design assessments to detailed structural health monitoring.
  
- **WebAssembly Support**: By supporting WebAssembly, we enable the toolkit to run in web browsers across different platforms, maintaining high performance and security standards. This feature allows for the development of interactive, web-based structural analysis applications, broadening the toolkit's accessibility and usability.
  
- **Edge Computing Compatibility**: Enabled by WebAssembly, our toolkit excels at edge computing, allowing for real-time structural analysis close to data sources. This feature is crucial for rapid decision-making in scenarios like in-field evaluations, IoT monitoring of structural health, and managing large-scale construction networks. WebAssembly's efficiency ensures low latency and reduced bandwidth usage, enabling fast and effective analysis anywhere. This makes our toolkit a versatile and responsive solution for modern engineering challenges.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (latest stable version recommended). If you don't have Rust installed, you can download it from [the official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository. If not, download it from [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Isbak/fatigue.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd fatigue
```
3. Compile the project
```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Setting Up Rust for WebAssembly
Embark on the journey of WebAssembly development with Rust by following these steps to set up your environment:

Install Rust: If Rust isn't already your trusty sidekick, install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), ensuring you have the latest stable version.

Add the WebAssembly Target: Unleash Rust's full potential by adding WebAssembly as a compilation target:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
rustup target add wasmi
```
Install wasm-pack: To seamlessly pack your Rust code into WebAssembly, wasm-pack is the tool for the job, facilitating both compilation and packaging.

Optional Tools:

wasm-bindgen: For interacting between WebAssembly modules and JavaScript.
cargo-generate: To kickstart a Rust-WebAssembly project with a template.
web-sys: A crate providing bindings for Web APIs.
Compile Your Project: Navigate to your project directory and run:

```sh
wasm-pack build
```
Integration into Web Projects: Use the generated .wasm file along with the wasm-bindgen or web-sys crates to integrate Rust-powered functionality directly into your web applications.

This setup primes your Rust environment for diving into the vast sea of WebAssembly, ensuring your projects can ride the waves of the web with the power and safety of Rust.

```sh
cargo build --features wasm --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

## Usage
Here are some examples of how you can use the application or library:
```sh
fatigue -run yourconfig.yaml
```
