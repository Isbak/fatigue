# Safe and Fast Structural Fatigue Assessment as Code in Rust

## Overview

This project aims to provide a reliable and efficient tool for conducting structural fatigue assessments, leveraging the Rust programming language's safety and performance features. Designed with the engineering community in mind, it offers a code-based approach to evaluate structural integrity under cyclic loading conditions, crucial for various industries including aerospace, automotive, construction, and more.

The implementation focuses on modern fatigue analysis methods and algorithms, ensuring high accuracy and computational efficiency. By utilizing Rust, we emphasize safety (both in terms of software reliability and engineering outcomes) and speed, catering to large-scale simulations and data-intensive computations.

## Features

- **Safety and Reliability**: Built in Rust to minimize common programming errors and ensure robust execution.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed, facilitating rapid assessments of complex structural models.
- **Modular Design**: Easy integration into existing engineering workflows or as part of a larger analysis pipeline.
- **Open Source**: Encouraging collaboration and contributions from the engineering and scientific community.
